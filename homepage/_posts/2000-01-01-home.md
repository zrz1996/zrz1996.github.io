## About Me

I am a first year Ph.D student studying Computer Science at University of Texas at Austin, advised by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Prof. Dana Moshkovitz</a>. My research is mainly focused on algorithms and complexity theory, especially in Hardness of Approximation.

My current projects is about FPT (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_complexity#FPT">fixed parameter tractable</a>) inapproximability, including the hardness results for k-Clique and other interesting problem in fine-grained complexity. 

I am also interested in topics such as pseudorandomness, coding theory and graph isomorphism.
